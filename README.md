# encryption-decryption

Encryption and decryption are fundamental requirements of every secure-aware application, therefore the Java platform provides strong support for encryption and decryption through its Java Cryptographic Extension (JCE) framework which implements the standard cryptographic algorithms such as AES, DES and RSA. Basically encrypt and decrypt files using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm. AES is a symmetric-key algorithm that uses the same key for both encryption and decryption of data.
